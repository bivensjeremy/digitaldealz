                First and foremost, this is a real working website. Yes, the shopping cart, payment information and other functions work. <em>If you buy something and proceed through the shopping cart,</em> I will ship it. Please read through the <Link to='/FAQ'>FAQs</Link> if you have questions about my store policies.

            <p class="text-light">
                This project is a representation of my experience in React.  Without going into much detail as to what React is (for the non-coders in the house), a great way to get practice in this coding language is through a commerce website.

                Where did all these clothes come from, you ask? In my college days, between 2006-2012, I worked in a clothing store in the mall.  As such, I had access to all the latest fashion! As you may remember, the 2000s was a crazy time for hip-hop.  We did not exactly buy clothes true to our size! Many of the clothes are much bigger than I can ever hope to fit ðŸ¤£ ! What this means to you is, most are extremely lightly worn. Because they've always been in such good condition, I have been reluctant to throw them away.  I've always intended to sell them at the flea market, but I have no desire to wheel, deal and haggle.
